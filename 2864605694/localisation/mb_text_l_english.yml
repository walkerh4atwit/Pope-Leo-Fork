 zwinglist_religion_desc:0 "Zwinglism covers a wide range of religious traditions beginning with the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli. Zwinglists, originating in Switzerland like Calivinist, stress the belief of divine sovereignty over all creation, but have a milder view of original sin along with a wide hope of salvation.

Vasantine beliefs originate from Lutheranism, but with some distinctions. For instance, the church is under complete control by the state and the reigning monarch, as well as, clergymen being subjected to secular law and only allowing scripture from the Bible to be taught in sermons. Vasantines frown upon pilgrimages and relics."

 julianic_religion_desc:0 "Servetusic covers a wide range of religious traditions which are based on the writings of scholar and reformer, Michael Servetus. Servetusics are quite different from both Catholic and Reformation faiths, asserting that the Word is eternal, a mod of god's self expression, whereas the spirit is god's motion or power within the hearts of humans. To them, the son is the union of the eternal word with the man, Jesus."
 arminian_religion_desc:0 "Arminianism covers a wide range of religious traditions which originated in the Lowlands after disagreements with the ongoing reformation movement by the popular reformer Jacobus Arminius. Arminianists find their origin in Calvinism, but with some key differences, such as, their emphasis on man's responsibility and free will. Arminianists also believe predestination is too harsh, believing in more of a conditional election view, allowing man and god to take part in the salvation process."
 socinian_religion_desc:0 "Socinianism covers a wide range of religious traditions inspired by the reformation and brought to the east by the Italian reformers Fausto Paolo Sozzini and Lelio Sozzini.

 molinist_religion_desc:0 "Molinism covers a wide range of religious traditions originating in Aragon following the writings of theologian Luis de Molina. Molinists believe god is completely sovereign and that man is also free, and avoid the view that god decrees who will be saved or damned without any meaningful impact of their own free choice.

 mb.1.t:0 "The Zwinglist Branch"
 mb.1.d:0 "Huldrych Zwingli, a Swiss reformer, has been known for several years as a people's priest in Zurich. He first gained infamy in 1522 when he attacked the custom of fasting during Lent. Also being well known for condemning the corruption in the ecclesiastical heirarchy, promoting clerical marriage, and attacking the use of images in places of worship. His ideas were picked up quickly in the areas surrounding Switzerland, and soon an alliance of cantons, following Zwingli, divided the region. Soon they found themselves at war with the cantons which refused to convert to his ideas. Zwingli would die on the battlefield, after being ill-prepared for an attack from the catholic side."

 mb.2.t:0 "The Presbyterian Branch"
 mb.2.d:0 "John Knox was a Scottish minister, theologian, reformer, and writer. Knox got caught up in a conspiracy involving the murder of a cardinal and the intervention of a queen regent, resulting in him being taken prisoner by the French, and being exiled to England the following year. In England he rose through the ranks of the Church of England, where he eventually came to serve King Edward VI as royal chaplain. When Mary I ascended the throne and re-established Catholicism, Knox was forced to resign and leave England. He would travel central Europe, learning from other reformers such as John Calvin. Inspired by George Wishart, who was burned at the stake for his heresies, Knox would pick up his momentum, and create a new order of service, which would eventually be adopted by the reformed church in Scotland."

 mb.3.d:0 "Gustav Vasa was king of Sweden from 1523 to 1560, formerly the protector of the realm during the Swedish War of Liberation against Denmark and Norway, Gustav rose to lead the rebel movement following the Stockholm Bloodback where his father was executed. Gustav's election and triumphant entry into Stockholm marked Sweden's final secession from the Kalmar Union. As king, Gustav was a ruthless administrator, brutally supressing uprisings, raising taxes, and bringing the reformation to Sweden. Replacing local landowners, noblemen, and clergy, with centrally appointed governors and bishops. His 37 year rule, saw a complete break with not only the Danish-Norwegian supremacy, but also the Roman Catholic Church, whose assets were then nationalised, with the Church of Sweden establish under his personal control."

 mb.4.t:0 "The Tausenite Branch"
 mb.4.d:0 "After getting favor from the former king Frederik I, the reformer Hans Tausen planted the seeds for reformation in Denmark, but after the king's death, the local clergy put Tausen to trial for heresy. News of the trial spread, and the public was outraged. Despite being found guilty, the clergy knew they would be slaughtered if he wasn't release, so his punishment was never enforced. The king's successor, Frederik II, would not condemn the practices of Tausen, therefore, the beliefs of a united evangelicalism would take hold of the nation."

 mb.5.t:0 "The Huguenot Branch"
 mb.5.d:0 "The Huguenots were a religious group of French protestants who name likely derives from that of a Swiss political leader, Bezanson Hugues. The word Huguenot was often used in reference to those of the reformed Church of France, whose populations were concentrated in the southern and western parts of the kingdom. As the Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew. A series of religious wars, known as the French Wars of Religion, fought throughout the 16th century, would grant the reformed French substantial autonomy. Later, more Huguenot rebellions would result in the abolition of their privileges and persecution until they were later forced to convert or flee."

 mb.6.t:0 "The Servetusic Branch"
 mb.6.d:0 "Michael Servetus was a Spanish theologian, physician, cartographer, and renaissance humanist. The first European to correctly describe the function of pulmonary circulation, he was versed in many sciences, including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and many, many, more. He was not only renown in the sciences, but also for his participation in the reformation. His rejection of the trinity doctrine and mainstream catholic christology, led to his condemnation by Catholic authorities in France and his fleeing to Geneva, a hub of the reformation. Servetus published many relgious works, even condemning Calvin's beliefs of predestination, noting that god condemns no one who does not condemn himself through thought, word, or deed. Calvin sent a copy of his own book as his reply, to which Servetus promptly returned it including annocations with critical observations. In time, their correspondence grew more heated, eventually ending with him being burned at the stake for heresy along with his books, no doubt, a fate sealed by Calvin himself."
 mb.6.a:0 "The future of Europe looks uncertain."

 mb.7.t:0 "The Arminianist Branch"
 mb.7.d:0 "Jacobus Arminius, a known critic of the reformation and opponent of Calvinism, developed in reaction, a theological system known later to be Arminianism. Specifically, Arminian thought the Calvinist view on predestination seemed too harsh a position because it did not provide a place for the exercise of human free will in the process of salvation. Hence, Arminius came to assert a conditional election, according to which, God elects to eternal life those who will respond in faith to the divine offer of salvation. Arminianism places a greater emphasis on God's mercy. After his death, his followers gave support to his views by signing the theological document known as the Remonstrance, which would later be debated in the Dutch reformed church. The debate would result in Arminianism being discredited and condemned, and its followers being persecuted. But persection has yet to break the followers of Arminius."

 mb.8.t:0 "The Socinianist Branch"
 mb.8.d:0 "Fausto Paolo Sozzini, also known as Faustus Socinus, alongside his uncle Lelio Sozzini, were Italian reformers from Siena. Coming of age, he traveled between Lyon and Geneva, finding that the reformers their were not radical enough. In his writing, the Brevis Explicatio, he writes that he attributes to Christ, an official, not an essential deity, and that he rejects the immortality of the soul in favour of mortalism. His anti-Trinitarian beliefs and writings gained the notice of Giorgio Biandrata, a court physician in Poland and Transylvania, which at the time, enjoyed full religious liberty. Sozzini traveled to Transylvania, aiming to convert a bishop at Biandrata's request, but failed, resulting in the bishop going to trial and perishing. The remainder of his life was spent in Poland, where he would influence the beliefs of the Polish Brethren and the Polish and Transylvanian Churches."

 mb.9.t:0 "The Bironic Branch"
 mb.9.d:0 "Sometime between 1527 and 1529 Matthias Devai Biro would become a supporter of the protestant reformation, and in 1529 he traveled to Wittenberg to study under Martin Luther. He returned to Buda by 1531, becoming the minister of a protestant congregation, whose ideas were able to flourish in Hungary at this time because of the general breakdown in church discipline after nearly all church pishops were killed at the Battle of Mohacs. The Kingdom of Hungary, in general, was in disarray, and during his time in Buda, Devay wrote a work denouncing prayer to saints and published 52 propositions explaining the protestant position. Biro would convince members of the Batthyany and Bocskay families to support his reformation, and a distinct Hungarian identity formed as Hungarian protestants came to distinguish between their faith and what they call German faith i.e. Lutheranism."

 mb.0.t:0 "The Radzianist Branch"
 mb.0.d:0 "Mikolaj 'the Black' Radziwill along with his cousin, Mikolaj 'the Red' Radziwill, were Polish-Lithuanian nobles who held several administrative positions within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Mikolaj the Black was able to gain incredible political influence thanks to the romance between his cousin Barabara Radziwill and the King of Poland. This made him one of the most powerful royal advisors and also immensely wealthly. However, this didn't help the fact that Mikolaj the Black, and his cousin, the Red, were fervent opponents of a closer union with Poland. Perhaps more importantly, Mikolaj was well known for his religious beliefs, as he was one of the most prominent converts and advocates of the reformed churches throughout the Commonwealth. He provided financial support for the printing of the first complete Polish translation of the Bible and distributed works written in defense of the reformation, allowing his ideas to take hold in the population."

 mb.10.t:0 "The Molinist Branch"
 mb.10.d:0 "Heresies within the Jesuit order have taken hold after the abandonment of large regions by the Catholic church. Many have been influenced by the ideas of the theologian Luis de Molina, and their belief in an omniscience and all knowing deity which works in the lives of the faithful has branded them as a unique branch of the reformation."

 EVTNAME2001:0 "The Protestant Reformation Begins"
 EVTDESC2001:0 "Martin Luther was a German priest, theologian, author, and hymnwriter. Ordained to priesthood in 1507, he came to reject many of the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church, indulgences in particular. His proposal of an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517, led to his eventual excommunication by the pope and outlaw by the Holy Roman Emperor at the Diet of Worms in 1521. Luther's beliefs that salvation and eternal life are not earned by good deeds but are recieved only as a free gift of God's grace through faith became popular throughout the northern Holy Roman Empire, and eventually, his following would leave a tremendous impact on the church, German culture, and Europe, forever."
 EVTOPTA2001:0 "The future of Europe looks uncertain."

 EVTNAME2011:0 "The Calivinist Branch"
 EVTDESC2011:0 "Jean Calvin was a French theologian, pastor, and reformer in Geneva. His beliefs proposed predestination, and that God had absolute sovereighty in the salvation of the human soul from death and eternal damnation. His docterines were influenced by Augustinian, among other Christian traditions, and he was a tireless polemicist and apologetic writer, who generated much controversy. After breaking away from the church around 1530, following the eruption of religious tensions and deadly violence against the protestants in France, Calvin fled to Switzerland, where he published his writings and would join the reformation in Geneva. His influence would only grow from here, and would eventually come to support many other reformers, becoming a central figure in the reformation."

 desc_union_of_reform:0 "In Poland, the young reforation was divided over the Trinity, and while Radziwiłł 'the Black' initially supported the Trinitarian side, he came under the influence of Socinianism and altered his position. He tried to defend the latter before Calvin, but in an angry letter from the Swiss reformer, Radziwiłł was alienated. Thus he began replacing Calvinist ministers with Arian ones. Though he supported the Arians, Radziwiłł hoped Arians and Calvinists would join together and form a broad non-dogmatic protestant church."
